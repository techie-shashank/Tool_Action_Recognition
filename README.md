# Tool Action Recognition on Multi-Sensor, Multi-Modal Time-Series Data

This project focuses on **tool action recognition using deep and semi-supervised learning approaches** on **multi-sensor, multi-modal time-series data** collected from hand-held tools (e.g., electric screwdrivers, pneumatic rivet guns). The goal is to accurately identify tool actions while minimizing the need for labeled data, leveraging **semi-supervised LSTM and TCN models**.
