# 🛠️ Tool-Tracking Data Visualizer

The src/visualisation.py visualizes multi-sensor time-series data collected from hand-held tools, overlaid with annotated action labels. It supports data from tools like electric screwdrivers, pneumatic rivet guns, and more.

## 🚀 How to Run

To visualize the multi-sensor data along with action annotations, use the following command:

```bash
python src/visualisation.py --base_path "/path/to/tool-tracking-data" --tool "tool_name"
